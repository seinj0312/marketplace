☐ Use ?? and .? operators where possible

☐ Get the settings modal working
  - It looks like it's applying but I need to update state on the App, and the modal isn't updating...
  - Using the `app.triggerRefresh` makes it apply in real time in the background (e.g. when toggling stars)
  - Using a `forceUpdate` in the `SettingsToggle` can make the toggle update
  - It's probably because the modal isn't in the app's component tree, so state changes don't affect it!
